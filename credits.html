        <p>This digital edition was co-edited by Zoe Braccia and Whitney Trettien. Transcription and initial editorial work began in Summer 2018; after a project hiatus, the website was completed between July and December 2020, for a January 2021 release.</p>

        <p>It is built on <a href="https://sims2.digitalmappa.org/" target="_blank">an instance of Digital Mappa</a> hosted by the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
